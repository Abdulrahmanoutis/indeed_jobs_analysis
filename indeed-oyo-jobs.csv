### **About Sun King**


Sun King is the world’s leading off\-grid solar energy company, combining cutting\-edge product design, fintech, and field operations to deliver energy access for the 1\.8 billion people who live without an affordable and reliable electric\-grid connection. Sun King has connected more than 20 million homes to solar power across Africa and Asia, adding over 200,000 homes each month.  

Sun King makes solar products affordable to low\-income households and businesses via ‘pay\-as\-you\-go’ purchase financing. Sun King installs solar after customers pay a small deposit. Customers then make small, manageable payments of as little as US $0\.11 a day via mobile money or cash.  

Instead of paying for expensive, polluting, and health\-damaging kerosene for lighting or diesel for power, customers unlock savings through accessing solar power and after one to two years of payments, customers own their solar equipment outright. To date, our Sun King solar products have saved customers more than $4 billion cumulatively.  

  

Sun King collects payments digitally through mobile money systems and its 28,000 field agents — over 650,000 payments each day. Embedded electronics inside each Sun King device regulate usage based on payments, similar to the operation of a pre\-paid mobile or electricity meter.  

From cost\-effective solar systems that provide home lighting and phone charging to robust solar inverters that can power high\-energy appliances such as laptops, computers, refrigerators, and more, effectively acting as a full stand\-in for grid power, Sun King’s products cater to a wide range of income segments and energy needs. Leveraging its proven distribution network and brand, Sun King is expanding its range of products and services to encompass clean cooking, electric mobility, entertainment, and more, aiming to address the needs of our underserved customers.
  

Sun King employs 2,800 full\-time staff in 12 countries, with specialties spanning product design, data science, logistics, customer service, sales, software, operations, and more — all with a passion to serve off\-grid families.  

Sun King is committed to gender diversity in the workplace. Women represent 44% of Sun King’s workforce.",,https://ng.indeed.com/cmp/Sun-King,,,,,,
