**The Foundation**  

  

We are the largest nonprofit fighting poverty, disease, and inequity around the world. Founded on a simple premise: people everywhere, regardless of identity or circumstances, should have the chance to live healthy, productive lives. We believe our employees should reflect the rich diversity of the global populations we aim to serve. We provide an exceptional benefits package to employees and their families which include comprehensive medical, dental, and vision coverage with no premiums, generous paid time off, paid family leave, foundation\-paid retirement contribution, regional holidays, and opportunities to engage in several employee communities. As a workplace, we’re committed to creating an environment for you to thrive both personally and professionally.
  

  

**The Team**  

  

The focus of the Nigeria Country Office (NCO) team is to enable collective impact for the foundation in Nigeria by informing policy and finance towards key development priorities, strengthening capacity and enabling systems for delivery, and innovating and leveraging cross\-cutting enablers for impact at scale. With over a decade of experience working in Nigeria, the Foundation has made significant progress and developed critical relationships with federal, state, and private sector actors; civil society organizations; traditional leaders; development partners; and nongovernmental stakeholders. While we have made progress on output and outcome milestones, Nigeria still has challenges (e.g. highest disease burden as a single country globally, 10% of global maternal mortality, low cereal yield compared to African peers, \>50% unbanked adult population). Progress has been limited in driving improvement in key impact measures such as smallholder farmer income, access to financial solutions, and maternal \& neonatal mortality. Addressing gaps in Nigeria is key to advancing the foundations’ global mission of creating a world where every person can live a healthy, productive life.
  

  

**Your Role**  

  

The **Deputy Director \- Health Systems Strengthening, Nigeria** will lead the development and implementation of the Nigeria team’s strategies in health systems strengthening (HSS), including a focus on primary health care. This role will work collaboratively with programmatic, functional, and cross\-division partners within the country office team and across the foundation, to develop and lead a portfolio of grants at the country, regional and global level to achieve results. The focus of the Nigeria team is to enable the work of foundation teams that are involved in the development, testing and scale\-up of high impact and cost\-effective solutions to achieve sustained impact at scale across Nigeria. S/he will serve as a member of the leadership team, playing a critical role in shaping the direction of the foundation’s HSS work and team management in Nigeria.
  

  

The postholder will be based at the foundation’s NCO in **Abuja** , and report to the Director, NCO.

UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.


UN Women supports UN Member States as they set global standards for achieving gender equality and work with governments and civil society to design laws, policies, programmes, and services needed to ensure that the standards are effectively implemented and truly benefit women and girls worldwide. It works globally to make the vision of the Sustainable Development Goals a reality for women and girls and stands behind women’s equal participation in all aspects of life, focusing on four strategic priorities:


* Women lead, participate in and benefit equally from governance systems
* Women have income security, decent work and economic autonomy
* All women and girls live a life free from all forms of violence
* Women and girls contribute to and have more significant influence in building sustainable peace and resilience and benefit equally from the prevention of natural disasters and conflicts and humanitarian action

UN Women also coordinates and promotes the UN system’s work in advancing gender equality in all deliberations and agreements linked to the 2030 Agenda. The entity works to position gender equality as fundamental to the Sustainable Development Goals and a more inclusive world.


**Consultancy Background**

The UN Conference of the Parties (COP 21\) in Paris in December 2015 was a success in many respects. One of the key reasons was the momentum across national governments to develop their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) before the COP. Although NDCs are about countries’ climate policy commitments, many countries also use the opportunity to embed climate policies within their broader development agenda and highlight cross\-cutting priorities such as gender issues. For example, according to an analysis by Women Environment and Development Organization (WEDO), 64 of 190 analyzed NDCs reference women or gender and all 64 countries are non\-Annex I parties and most commonly about climate change adaptation. Among 64 countries, the most common way that the position/ role of women is identified as a vulnerable group. Moreover, gender equality in climate actions is also recognized in the Preamble of the Paris Agreement and Articles on Adaptation Action and Capacity Development.


The 2030 Agenda aims to shift global development to sustainability and resilience. Gender equality is integral to the agenda and cannot be separated from the challenges of poverty, hunger, poor health, well\-being, hardship, environmental burden, etc. Besides, climate change also cuts across all the SDGs. It is recognized to have the potential to increase resource scarcity, undermine livelihoods, and increase migration and forced displacement pressures.


Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy, has a key role to play in delivering the aims of the Paris Agreement in the continent of Africa. Today, one ﬁfth of Africans, some 200 million people, are Nigerians. The World Bank projects that Nigeria will become the world’s third most populous country by 2050, with over 400 million people. Nigeria has an important leadership role as a country that is both highly vulnerable to climate change's impacts and one of the largest emitters of GHG emissions across Africa.


Nigeria submitted its first NDC in 2015 and the revised NDC in 2021\. Nigeria recommits to its unconditional contribution of reducing emissions by 20% below the business\-as\-usual scenario by 2030 and increased its conditional target to a 47% reduction in emissions by the same year. In the updated NDC, Nigeria has increased its ambitions with newly added sectors, including the waste and water sectors, and new gases, including short\-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). The updated NDC broadens the scope and coverage of the country's climate commitments in the energy and efficiency, agriculture, oil and gas, power, infrastructure and housing sectors. Nigeria strives to achieve net zero by 2060\.


Nigeria is currently in the process of revising the third version of its NDC, with the support of United Nations agencies, financial institutions and other key development partners, a rigorous process that reviews every detail of the previous NDC commitment with current findings changes in contexts and other national and international developments. It is anticipated that the NDC 3\.0 will be richly gender inclusive across all sectors and have gender as a standalone component to foster gender equality and social inclusion in the implementation of the framework.


The submission for the government approval is expected in the 2nd quarter of 2025\.


In this process, the Gender Core group *(a team of gender experts from various UN agencies, government, consultants and development partners)* will continue to provide technical support to NCCC on gender mainstreaming in the NDC revision process, focusing on providing recommendations on gender issues in the NDC and capacity building for government officers in line ministries on gender and climate change. UN Women is seeking a national consultant to provide advisory support on gender equality and social inclusion, conduct assessments of the seven NDC sectors (water, power, waste management, agriculture \& forestry, oil \& gas, industry, and transportation), conduct Focus group discussions with a gender focus, make recommendations for each sector based on the findings from the assessment, and support the capacity\-building activities throughout the drafting process of the NDC 3\.0\.


**Objective**

The overall objective of the consultancy is to provide advisory support to the NDC facilitator for a gender\-sensitive review of the NDC 3\.0, covering all seven sectors (water, power, waste management, agriculture \& forestry, oil \& gas, industry, and transportation). The purpose of this consultancy is:


* to strengthen the reflection of gender equality and social inclusion in the NDC 3\.0 and related documents (review reports, technical reports, monitoring and evaluation framework, etc.);
* to support capacity building for relevant stakeholders, including line ministries, gender machinery, and NGOs on gender and the NDC.

2\. The TAF is set up as a Team Europe Initiative tool to deliver, in a reactive, flexible and on demand basis, the adequate technical assistance to meet the needs of the AfCFTA Secretariat, African Union Commission and AU specialized agencies, Regional Economic Communities (RECs), AU Member states, continental and regional private sector organizations, and other potential partners working on implementing the AfCFTA and African economic integration.

 **Objectives and outputs of the EU\-TAF**

  



3\. The EU\-TAF seeks to contribute to African economic integration through the realisation of the AfCFTA (**overall objective**). It has two specific objectives:


 i. enhance the capacity for preparing and conducting the remaining negotiations, and


 ii. strengthen the institutional capacity of targeted African institutions and countries to successfully implement the AfCFTA.


4\. Under its phase 1, the work of the EU\-TAF is structured across 5 outputs. The outputs capture the support provided with different partners on different levels (continental, regional, national).

  

§ Output 1: The capacity of the AfCFTA Secretariat is enhanced, for preparing and conducting the remaining AfCFTA negotiations (all phases), as well as for steering the implementation of the AfCFTA Agreement.


§ Output 2: The capacity of AUC to advance continental economic and industrial policies complementary to the AfCFTA is strengthened.


§ Output 3: The capacities of targeted RECs and AU specialized agencies to implement AfCFTA\-related priority reforms and to facilitate cross\-REC exchanges are strengthened.


§ Output 4: The capacities of countries to implement AfCFTA commitments are strengthened, and trade regulatory practices are improved.


§ Output 5: Continental and regional private sector organisations’ engagement in AfCFTA is enhanced

 **The EU\-TAF approach**


5\. Under its phase 1, the EU\-TAF uses two complementary approaches to provide technical assistance. These are:

***Work plan approach (AfCFTA Secretariat and AUC – Output 1 and 2\)***

* This approach is targeted at Output 1 and Output 2, which are implemented in partnership with the AfCFTA Secretariat and the African Union Commission respectively.
* Under this approach, the EU\-TAF will develop annual work plans based on priority needs related to AfCFTA negotiations and implementation, as well as other economic continental integration processes.

 ***An Ad\-hoc Support Fund (REC, AU specialised agencies, Member States, private sector level – Output 3 to 5\)***

* This approach is targeted at the RECs, AU specialized agencies, AU Member States, and continental and regional private sector organizations.
* The objective is to respond to the beneficiaries evolving needs to strengthen their capacities to engage in the AfCFTA implementation process to successfully implement the AfCFTA.
* Under this approach, the targeted beneficiaries will be required to submit requests for support to the EU\-TAF Project Management Unit (PMU).

  



6\. Activities under the EU\-TAF may include, but are not limited to, the following:

  

 i. Technical expertise.


 ii. Training and capacity building.


 iii. Secondments to Member Countries and RECs.


 iv. Missions and study visits.


 v. Studies and publications.


 vi. Diagnostic tools.


 vii. Communication, sensitization, visibility \& dissemination.


 viii. Seminars \& workshops.


 ix. TAF Semi\-twinning among EU\-Africa organisations, or intra\-African organisations


 x. Any other requests that support the implementation of the AfCFTA
**Context of the assignment**  

7\. The ECOWAS Regional Strategy for the implementation of the AfCFTA was adopted in July 2023 by the 90th Ordinary Session of the ECOWAS Council of Ministers. Under the supervision of the Commissioner for Economic Affairs and Agriculture and the coordination of the Directorate of Trade, all technical Directorates of the Department have a role to play in the operationalization of the Regional Strategy.


8\. Moreover, in furtherance to the Agreement of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the ECOWAS Directorate of Trade is in charge of the overall monitoring of the implementation of the AfCFTA.


9\. Under the current staffing situation at the ECOWAS Commission and its Agencies, which is characterized by insufficient human resources, additional responsibilities arising out of the need for the implementation of AfCFTA obligations will need fully dedicated technical personnel working within the aforementioned Directorate to support effective monitoring and implementation of the AfCFTA.


10\. The support of a seconded staff on AfCFTA will facilitate the attainment of the continental as well as regional objectives of the socio\-economic integration of Countries in the African Region.


11\. The centrality and the importance of the ECOWAS Commission's Directorate of Trade in the context of regional implementation of the AfCFTA cannot be overstated because of the coordinating responsibility bequeathed to it within the ECOWAS organization, to drive and monitor AfCFTA implementation in the ECOWAS Region.

  

12\. It is against this background that the ECOWAS Commission, with the funding of the EU – TAF, seeks to engage the services of an Expert with an in\-depth knowledge of the AfCFTA to assist the ECOWAS Commission and its Member States to accelerate the implementation of the AfCFTA, among other critical tasks.

**The Position**

The Global Programme to enhance Reproductive Health Commodities Security (GPRHCS) is a part of the UNFPA’s global efforts to improve access to and utilization of family planning commodities worldwide. The Global programme works with national governments to strengthen or establish secure, reliable, cost\-effective, and sustainable systems to ensure supply of and demand for a wide range of reproductive health commodities: including contraceptives and condoms. With support from the GPRHCS, the UNFPA Country Office in the Federal Republic of Nigeria is working closely with Federal, States and Local Government counterparts in support of government\-led efforts to all aspects of in\-country demand for Family Planning services.


**How you can make a difference:**

UNFPA, the United Nations Population Fund, is the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency. UNFPA is the lead UN agency for delivering a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled. UNFPA’s strategic plan (2022\-2025\), focuses on three transformative results: to end preventable maternal deaths; end unmet need for family planning; and end gender\-based violence and harmful practices. UNFPA works to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment and to address the causes and consequences of GBV, especially its effects on sexual and reproductive health. UNFPA works to address gender\-based violence in both development and humanitarian contexts, where the risk of violence against women and girls intensifies.


UNFPA Nigeria commenced the implementation of the 9th Country Programme (CP) (2023\-2027\) of which the four main outputs are : (a) strengthened data systems; (b) strengthened capacities of national and subnational health systems to deliver quality sexual and reproductive health information and services; (c) strengthened capacity of critical actors and systems the provision of life and dignity\-saving interventions in humanitarian settings; (d) strengthened capacities and knowledge of critical actors to address discriminatory gender and social norms.

**The Position**



The Global Programme to enhance Reproductive Health Commodities Security (GPRHCS) is a part of the UNFPA’s global efforts to improve access to and utilization of family planning commodities worldwide. The Global programme works with national governments to strengthen or establish secure, reliable, cost\-effective, and sustainable systems to ensure supply of and demand for a wide range of reproductive health commodities: including contraceptives and condoms.

UNFPA works to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment and to address the causes and consequences of GBV, especially its effects on sexual and reproductive health.

**About Program/Project**



**Background** **and rationale**



Soil fertility and health in the Sahel region, particularly in Northern Nigeria, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger, is a critical factor influencing agricultural productivity, livelihoods, and food security. The Sahel is a semi\-arid region south of the Sahara Desert, characterized by erratic rainfall, high temperatures, and fragile ecosystems. The region is subject to climatic hazards and land degradation, which have a negative impact on crop yields. It is therefore important to develop technologies to maintain fertility and increase crop yields.



Achieving sustainable increases in soil fertility while boosting yields requires a complex set of practices to manage soils, crop residues, inputs, water, labor, crop diversification and rotations, and crop\-livestock integration. Many technologies and approaches were promoted to improve soil fertility and crop productivity in Sub Sahelian countries, like Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM). These technologies are used to increase crop yield and to maximize the efficiency of land, water, and nutrient management. ISFM is an approach that combines mineral fertilizers and organic amendments to offset nutrient depletion and build soil organic matter combined with water harvesting technologies, improved germplasm, agroforestry, crop rotation, or intercropping with legumes. Integrated Soil Fertility Management (ISFM) practices are meant to improve soil fertility and increase yields of small\-scale food producers, but the adoption of technologies and practices has been limited because they are not specific to soil and crop types and often address a single problem. Adoption of practices by farmers is driven by short\-term tangible incentives such as yield, and income increase while improving soil fertility is a long\-term process with limited immediate tangible effects.



The Dutch government is dedicated to advancing food security and promoting sustainable soil management aligning with the sustainable development goals. The Dutch Directorate General for International Cooperation (DGIS) has crafted a policy framework that explicitly incorporates soil fertility enhancement into a comprehensive approach, considering both agroecological and socio\-economic dimensions. It is under this framework, that a consortium consisting of the International Fertilizer Development Center (IFDC), the Netherlands Development Organization (SNV), and Wageningen University (WUR) has secured funding from the Dutch Directorate General for International Cooperation (DGIS) for the Soil Values program, expected to be implemented from 2024 to 2033\.



The primary objective of the Soil Values program is to manage soil fertility and health sustainably, aiming to enhance agricultural productivity in an environmentally conscious manner while bolstering the resilience of small\-scale farmers in the Sahel region, including women, men, and youth, against the impacts of climate change and related shocks.



Specifically, with over a decade of implementation, the Soil Values program seeks to establish sustainable soil fertility management as a cornerstone of farming practices in the Sudano\-Sahelian savannah. It aims to enhance soil fertility and productive capacity across 2 million hectares of farmland in the Sahel region, while also enhancing the resilience and livelihoods of 1\.5 million small\-scale farmers, particularly women, in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger, and Northern Nigeria.



The Soil Values program is spearheaded by a consortium consisting of IFDC, WUR, and SNV, in collaboration with five partner technical institutions: AGRA, ICRAF, IITA, ISRIC, and IWMI. These institutions are renowned for their expertise and will lend their support to various aspects of the program's implementation.



The program's interventions are focused on five key intervention areas:


* Bundling: Tailoring technology packages to suit local farming conditions, integrating both agro\-technical and socio\-economic strategies for sustainable soil fertility and health management.
* Integrating: Facilitating participatory planning to enhance ecosystem and watershed management, ensuring the efficient integrated utilization of soil, water, and biodiversity resources.
* Brokering: Exploring financial instruments to mobilize funding from farmers, agro\-pastoralists, and other stakeholders, promoting sustainable soil fertility management and soil health.
* Convening: Establishing consultation frameworks to collaboratively develop policies that accommodate stakeholder interests, effectively integrating sustainable soil fertility management practices.
* Scoping and Learning: Identifying innovative approaches and fostering program learning to continually improve soil management practices and outcomes.


In the implementation of its activities, the ""Soil Values"" program has identified, in synergy with national partners, six watersheds (Yariti \& Fajewa\-Kano, Birnin Kudu \& Ringim\-Jigawa, Jama’are \& Bauchi\-Bauchi) in Nigeria in which the program activities will be carried out. During the inception phase of the Program, community diagnostics and technical sessions were organized with national partner programs/projects to identify collaborative actions for improving soil fertility and increasing crop yields. For the effective implementation of these activities, it is important to consider proven ISFM approaches and new varieties of priority crops.

**Call for Application for Masters Students to conduct Research within the NORA Research Project**


The Institute of Human Virology (IHVN) is a leading and reputable non\-governmental organization addressing infectious and non\-infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and cancer through prevention, diagnosis, treatment, capacity building, research, care, and support services. IHVN is in partnership with local and international organizations and the different tiers of the government of Nigeria at the national, state, and local levels. The Institute aims to provide quality health services, capacity building, and research in West Africa and beyond.


**About the project**


Cancer causes an estimated 533,000 deaths in the Sub\-Saharan Africa (SSA) annually. Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the most common in the SSA, making women the more disproportionately affected demographic. The biggest challenges to cancer care in this region are the lack of sufficient data, implementation, monitoring, challenges to comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and multi\-level cancer care at all levels of the health system. The widely established benchmark indicators of adequate care are screening uptake, stage at presentation, time to diagnosis, and referral to treatment. Applied research aimed at substantially contributing to decreasing mortality must address key variables along the continuum of care such as, what is the pattern of cancer incidence, cancer stage, cancer survival and how does it change over time? How can the demand for cancer screening in rural and urban communities be increased? How can cancer care be successfully integrated in decentral primary care settings? How can hospital\-based cancer registries help trace patient journeys and support standardized treatment referral within a resource constrained setting.


The overall goal of the Network for Oncology Research in Africa (NORA) is to contribute to reducing mortality of Breast Cancer and Cervical Cancer in partner countries (Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia and Tanzania) that are part of the NORA consortium. NORA is set to carry out research which establishes evidence\-based breast cancer, cervical cancer screening, and treatment pathways applicable in SSA. The research also seeks to generate policy recommendations for effective cancer control strategies. Ultimately, the goal of NORA is to contribute to a significant reduction in breast cancer and cervical cancer mortality in Africa.


**In addition, NORA provides the following:**


* A platform for academics and young scientists with comprehensive methodological and management competencies, enabling them to take on long\-term applied research within the framework of national strategies.


* An advanced mentoring concept which gives scientists confidence to develop their individual research profiles.


* Intensive networking and participation in scientific events geared towards fostering a community of practice, aimed at shaping the African research agenda, and adapting it to population needs.



**Requirements for selection**


The project involves capacity building for scientists in the field of cancer research and is therefore offering opportunities for master’s students in target research themes along the cancer care continuum to develop their research, leadership skills and future independent research careers.


**Master Students interested in applying are expected to have:**

* A first degree in relevant health sciences


* Must be newly enrolled (**Not more than one month**) in a master’s degree program in Nigeria, within the field of epidemiology, public health, or implementation sciences for themes related to public health.

* **RT 1:1** Cancer registration, screening and surveillance
* **RT 3\.3**: Needs analysis and design of breast cancer primary clinic screening strategy; and the piloting, refining, and evaluation of selected implementation strategies at two primary health clinics in FCT
* **RT 3\.4**: Cervical cancer screening/triaging of patients to therapy
* Research experience will be an added advantage.


**Eligibility Criteria:**

The Institute of Human Virology (IHVN) is a leading and reputable non\-governmental organization addressing infectious and non\-infectious diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and cancer through the provision of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, capacity building, research, and care and support services. IHVN is in partnership with local and international organizations and the different tiers of the government of Nigeria at national, state and local levels. The Institute’s vision is to be a leader in providing quality health services, capacity building and research in West Africa and beyond.


To improve the well\-being of vulnerable households and to establish a solid foundation for a project proposal and implementation for a BMZ application, IHVN is calling for tenders to conduct a feasibility study on “**Food security and resilience strengthening for vulnerable groups through multi\-sectoral services in response to high birth rate, malaria prevalence, and agricultural potential.**”


**Terms of Reference**


* **Background**



High birth rates result in rapid population growth, causing a strain on available resources, especially in low and middle\-income countries like Nigeria (36\.026 births per 1000 people), increasing public expenditure needed to provide sufficiently for the population. Poverty, malnutrition, illness, and death are consequences of high population growth, especially among the vulnerable population. Illnesses such as malaria are prevalent in these poor countries located mostly in the tropics (51,000,000 cases in Nigeria annually). Young children, pregnant and breast\-feeding women are vulnerable due to reduced immunity. The cost of treating malaria imposes a further economic burden on already impoverished families. However, families can be empowered to be resilient by harnessing available natural resources, such as agricultural potential currently at 40% in Africa, to improve food security (especially in Nigeria, with 17 million people currently at risk of food insecurity) and economically strengthen the ability to cater for the family needs including preventing and treating illnesses, reducing malnutrition and death, especially among the vulnerable population.


Nigeria with a population growth rate of 2\.38% and a fertility rate of 5\.1 births per woman is experiencing rapid population growth (Statista, 2023\). Nigeria is unable to harness its large population to achieve its developmental goals as about 60% are dependent below the age of 25 with 40% of the population supposedly, the working age group left to cater for the vulnerable group (UNICEF,2022\). The results are plethora of developmental challenges including income inequality, inadequate access to basic services, and persistent poverty in some regions unemployment, lack of food, inadequate health care facilities to cater for the massive population, poor housing, increase in endemic illnesses such as malaria due to poor living conditions and generalized poverty/poor standard of living.


In line with the WHO technical frameworks, interventions such as the National Malaria Elimination Program (NMEP), the National Malaria Strategic Plan and Nigeria End Malaria Council were developed to end the malaria scourge (FMoH, 2022\). These programs have supported and promoted various strategies for malaria prevention and elimination. The Ministry of Women Affairs and Social Development also coordinates programming for orphans and vulnerable children. However, these interventions have not sufficiently provided relief for the vulnerable population.


This project aims to improve the overall well\-being of vulnerable households through food security, Malaria prevention, and Integrating SRH/FP among vulnerable households. It also aims to promote the empowerment of vulnerable households by increasing their agricultural potential, especially the most vulnerable. IHVN will partner with other Government and Non\-Governmental actors collaboratively on the project, with each actor contributing their unique skills and resources in a sustainable manner.


* **Purpose, Objective and Use**

Cancer causes an estimated 533,000 deaths in the Sub\-Saharan Africa (SSA) annually. Breast cancer and cervical cancer are the most common in the SSA, making women the more disproportionately affected demographic. The biggest challenges to cancer care in this region are the lack of sufficient data, implementation, monitoring, challenges to comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and multi\-level cancer care at all levels of the health system. The widely established benchmark indicators of adequate care are screening uptake, stage at presentation, time to diagnosis, and referral to treatment. Applied research aimed at substantially contributing to decreasing mortality must address key variables along the continuum of care such as, what is the pattern of cancer incidence, cancer stage, cancer survival and how does it change over time? How can the demand for cancer screening in rural and urban communities be increased? How can cancer care be successfully integrated in decentral primary care settings? How can hospital\-based cancer registries help trace patient journeys and support standardized treatment referral within a resource constrained setting.



The overall goal of the Network for Oncology Research in Africa (NORA) is to contribute to reducing mortality of Breast Cancer and Cervical Cancer in partner countries (Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia and Tanzania) that are part of the NORA consortium. NORA is set to carry out research which establishes evidence\-based breast cancer, cervical cancer screening, and treatment pathways applicable in SSA. The research also seeks to generate policy recommendations for effective cancer control strategies. Ultimately, the goal of NORA is to contribute to a significant reduction in breast cancer and cervical cancer mortality in Africa.


**In addition, NORA provides the following:**



* A platform for academics and young scientists with comprehensive methodological and management competencies, enabling them to take on long\-term applied research within the framework of national strategies.


* An advanced mentoring concept which gives scientists confidence to develop their individual research profiles.


* Intensive networking and participation in scientific events geared towards fostering a community of practice, aimed at shaping the African research agenda, and adapting it to population needs.



**Requirements for selection:**



The project involves capacity building for scientists in the field of cancer research and is therefore offering opportunities for postdoctoral fellows, PhD, and masters students in target research themes along the cancer care continuum to develop their research, leadership skills and future independent research careers.


**Students are expected to have:**

**Post\-doctoral position (1\)**



A PhD, and must be currently enrolled in a Postdoctoral training program in the field of epidemiology, public health, or implementation sciences and conducting research in cancer in Nigeria.


**PhD position (2\)**

**Masters position (6\)**



A first degree, and must be currently enrolled in a Master’s Degree program within the field of epidemiology, public health, or implementation sciences for themes related to public health and willing to conduct research in breast or cervical cancer as part of master’s dissertation in Nigeria.


**Eligibility Criteria:**



* Language requirement: Fluency in English (written and spoken)


* Interest in cancer research and a commitment to a career path in cancer epidemiology and cancer\-related research\-training


* Enrolled in a Masters, PhD, or Postdoctoral training programme in a recognized training institution prior to application.


* Willingness to centre thesis around the NORA research areas of cancer registration, breast and cervical cancer)


* Possess relevant skills such as leadership, teamwork, communication and creativity.
