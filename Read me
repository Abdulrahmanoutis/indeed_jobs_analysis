# Job Posting Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves scraping job postings from Indeed for different locations in Nigeria, analyzing job trends, and performing data-driven insights. The analysis is aimed at understanding job availability, categories, remote work trends, and other factors that may be useful for job seekers and employers.

## Data Collection
- **Source:** Indeed job postings
- **Scraping Tool:** `jobspy` Python library
- **Locations Covered:** Kano, Abuja, Rivers, Lagos and Oyo state
- **Format:** Data is saved as CSV files

## Steps Taken
### 1. Job Data Scraping
- Scraped job postings using the `jobspy` library.
- Fetched job details including title, company, location, date posted, job type, remote status, job category, etc
- Saved results for each city as a csv file

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded CSV files into Pandas DataFrames.
- Merged all the csv files for each state into one csv.
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies and handled them.
- Removed unneccessary columns
- Grouped Job titles into categories by matching them with appropriate keywords(tech,medical,sales, etc)
- some locations came with inconsistent naming, i corrected them and assigned appropriate names to each location

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed and visualized job Distribution by city.
- Analyzed and visualized top hiring companies.
- Analyzed and visualized job Types Distribution.
- Visualized the distribution of job postings by category.
- Analyzed and visualized job categories in each city.
- Determined which city has the most remote jobs.
- Determined which job category had the most remote jobs.
- Examined the time frame of job postings.

### 4. Findings
- The most in-demand job categories were identified.
- Remote job trends across different job categories were analyzed.
- Insights were derived to help job seekers understand hiring trends in Nigeria.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (for scripting and analysis)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Plotly** (for visualization)
- **Jobspy** (for job scraping)

## How to Reproduce
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas jobspy plotly
   ```
2. Run the job scraping scripts to collect fresh data.
3. Use Jupyter Notebook or a Python script to perform analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding the dataset to include more locations and industries.
- Implementing machine learning models to predict job trends.
- Automating job data collection on a regular basis.
